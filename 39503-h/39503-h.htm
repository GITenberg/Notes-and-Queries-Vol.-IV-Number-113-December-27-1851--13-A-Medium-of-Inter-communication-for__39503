<h3>
<span>HISTORICAL COINCIDENCES.<br />
<i>Barclay and Perkins.</i></span>
</h3>

<p>Have you ever amused yourself by tracing historical parallels? did you
ever note how often one age reflects the character of another, so that
the stage of real life seems to us at intervals as a theatre on which we
see represented the passions of the past, its political tendencies, and
monied speculations; the only change being that of costume, and a wider
but more modified method of action? So true it is that men change,
institutions vary, and that human nature is always the same. The church
reproduces its Laud, the railway exchange its Law, the bench has its
Mansfield, the Horse Guards its greater Marlborough, and Newgate its
Mrs. Brownrigg. We have giants as great as King Charles's porter, and a
Tom Thumb who would have frightened the very <i>ghosts</i> of all departed
Jeffery Hudsons,&mdash;a class not generally accused of fear, except at
daybreak,&mdash;by his unequalled <i>diminutiveness</i>. Take the great questions
which agitate the church and the senate-house, which agitated them in
the sixteenth, during much of the two following centuries, and you will
find the same theological, political, commercial, and sanitary questions
debated with equal honesty, equal truth, and similar prospects of
satisfactory solution. I confess, however, that for one historical
coincidence I was unprepared; and that "Barclay and Perkins," in the
case of assault upon a noted public character, should have an historical
antecedent in the seventeenth century, has caused me some surprise. It
is not necessary for me to recall to your attention how Barclay and
Perkins were noised about on the occasion of the attack on General
Haynau. The name of the firm was as familiar to our lips as their
porter:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Never came reformation in a flood</p>
    <p>  With such a <i>heady</i> currance."</p>
</div>

<p>There had been no similar <i>émeute</i>, as I was told by a civic wit, since
the days of "Vat Tyler." Now let me remind you of the Barclay and
Perkins and the other Turnham Green men's plot, who conspired to assault
and assassinate King William III. Mind, the coincidence is only in name.
The historic parallel is rather of kind than event, but it is not the
less remarkable when we consider the excitement twice connected with
these names. The character of James II. may be described as the
<i>villainy of weakness</i>. It possessed nothing of elevation, breadth, or
strength. It was this weak obliquity which made him deceive his people,
and led them to subvert the laws, supplant the church, and to become a
tyrant in the name of religious liberty. His means to recover the throne
were as mean as the manner of its desertion was despicable. He tried
cajolery, it failed; the bravery of his Irish soldiers, it was
unavailing. He next relied on the corruption of Russell, the avarice of
Marlborough; but as these men were to be bought as well as sold, he put
his trust finally in any villain who was willing to be hired for
assassination. In 1692 M. de Grandval, a captain of dragoons, was shot
in the allied camp,<a id="Page_498"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[498]</span> who confessed that King James at St. Germain,
in the presence of the queen, had engaged him to shoot King William.
Four years later James had contrived another plot. At the head of this
were Sir George Barclay and Sir William Perkins, and under their
guidance twenty men were engaged to assist in the assassination of King
William. The plan was as follows. It was the custom of the king to hunt
near the house of Mr. Latten, in the neighbourhood of Brentford, and
they designed to surprise the king on his return at a hollow part of the
road between Brentford and Turnham Green, one division of them being
placed behind some bushes and brushwood at the western end of the Green.
Some of your correspondents may perhaps fix the spot; but as the Green
extended then far beyond what it now does, I suspect it was about the
road leading to Gunnesbury; the road itself I recollect as a boy seeing
much elevated and improved. The design failed, two of the gang betrayed
the rest,&mdash;Barclay escaped, but Perkins and some others were hung.
Jeremy Collier attended them on the scaffold, and publicly gave them
absolution in the name of Christ, and by imposition of hands, for all
their sins. I need not describe to you the excitement caused by this
plot of Barclay and Perkins: the event connected with their names, as at
our later period&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

       <p class="i3"> "Was a theme of all conversation;</p>
     <p> Had it been a pillar of church and state,</p>
      <p>Or a prop to support the whole dead weight,</p>
     <p> It could not have furnished more debate</p>
       <p class="i3">For the heads and tails of the nation."</p>

</div>

<p>James closed the drama becomingly; he published a defence of his conduct
in a paper, the style of which has been well described as the "euphemism
of assassination." The road between Turnham Green and Kew was long after
associated with the names of "Barclay and Perkins."</p>

<h3>
<span>REMAINS OF KING JAMES II.</span>
</h3>

<p>The enclosed copy of an authentic document, obtained through the
kindness of Mr. Pickford, Her Majesty's consul in Paris, is communicated
to the publisher of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>", in the belief that it may prove
acceptable to those who take an interest in the questions raised by the
articles in Nos. 46. 48. and 56. of that valuable publication.</p>

<p>This document is an "Extract from the Register of the Deliberation of
the Municipal Council of St. Germain-en-Laye," dated July 12, 1824,
containing the official report, or <i>procès-verbal</i>, of the discovery
made that day of three boxes, in which were deposited a portion of the
remains of King James II. and of the Princess Louise-Marie, his
daughter.</p>

<p>The "annexes" referred to, of the respective dates of September 16 and
17, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 1701, leave no doubt as to the disposal of the royal corpse at
that time. With respect to its fate, after its removal from the English
Benedictine convent in Paris in 1793, as mentioned in the article No.
46., it is most probable that it shared the fate of other royal relics
exhumed at the same disastrous period from the vaults of St. Denys,
which were scattered to the winds, or cast into a common pit.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that the epitaph given in the same document, and
mentioned as being <i>such as it had existed</i> in the church of St.
Germain-en-Laye, had disappeared before the date of the "Extract from
the Register." It probably was destroyed during the first fury of the
French Revolution in 1793:&mdash;</p>

   avaient été temoins oculaires de ses excellentes vertus et de sa

   chrétien éloigné de ses états, et faire par ses infortunes et sa
   patience, triompher la réligion catholique, que de régner
   lui-même au milieu d'un peuple mutin et hérétique. Sa dernière
   maladie avait duré quinze jours, pendant lesquels il avait reçu
   deux fois le St. Viatique et l'extrême onction par les mains de
   Messire Jean François de Benoist, Docteur de la Maison de
   Sorbonne, prieur et curé de ce lieu, son propre pasteur, avec des
   sentimens d'une humilité profonde, qu'après avoir pardonné à tous
   les siens rebelles et ses plus cruels ennemis, il demanda même
   pardon à ses officiers, s'il leur avait donné quelque sujet de
   chagrin. Il avait donné aussi des marques de sa tendresse et
   réligion au Sérénissime Prince de Galles, son fils, digne
   héritier de ses couronnes aussi bien que de ses vertus, auquel il
   recommanda de n'avoir jamais d'autre règle de sa conduite que les
   maximes de l'Evangile, d'honorer toujours sa très vertueuse mère,
   aux soins de laquelle il le laissait, de se souvenir des bontés
   que Sa Majesté très chrétienne lui avait toujours témoigné, et de
   plutôt renoncer à tous ses états que d'abandonner la foi de
   Jésus-Christ. Tout le peuple tant de ce lieu que des environs ont
   eu la consolation de lui rendre les derniers devoirs et de la
   visiter pour la dernière fois en son lit de parade, où il demeura
   vingt-quatre heures exposé en vue, pendant lesquelles il fut
   assisté du clergé de cette église, des révérends pères Récollets

<h4><span> <i>The Wresting Thread.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;When a person has received a sprain, it
   is customary to apply to an individual practised in casting the
   "wrested thread." This is thread spun from black wool, on which
   are cast <i>nine</i> knots, and tied round a sprained leg or arm.
   During the time the operator is putting the thread round the
   affected limb, he says, in a muttering tone, in such a manner as
   not to be understood by the bystanders, nor even by the person
   operated upon&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "The Lord rade (rode),</p>
     <p> And the foal slade (slipped);</p>

</div>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#joint1" class="label">[1]</a> This charm is remarkable for its resemblance to an
   early German one found by Grimm in a MS. of the tenth century,
   originally published by him in 1842, and to be found, with
   references to Norwegian, Swedish, Flemish, and this Scottish
   version, in the second edition of his <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i>, s.
   1181-2.&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">ED.</span></p>



<h4>
 <span>  <i>Ringworm.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The person affected with ringworm takes a little
   ashes between the forefinger and thumb, three successive
   mornings, and before taking any food, and holding the ashes to
   the part affected, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"Ringworm! ringworm red!</p>
      <p>Never mayst thou spread or speed,</p>
      <p>But aye grow less and less,</p>
      <p>And die away among the ase (ashes)."</p>

</div>



<h4>
 <span>  <i>Burn.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;To cure a burn, the following words are used:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Here come I to cure a burnt sore;</p>
      <p>If the dead knew what the living endure,</p>
      <p>The burnt sore would burn no more."</p>

</div>

   <p>The operator, after having repeated the above, blows his breath
   three times upon the burnt place.</p>



<h4>
<span>   <i>Elfshot.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A notion is prevalent, that when a cow is suddenly
   taken ill, she is elfshot; that is, that a kind of spirits called
   "trows," different in their nature from fairies, have discharged
   a stone arrow at her, and wounded her with it. Though no wound
   can be seen externally, there are different persons, both male
   and female, who pretend to feel it in the flesh, and to cure it
   by repeating certain words over the cow. They also fold a sewing
   needle in a leaf taken from a particular part of a psalm book,
   and sew it in the hair of the cow; which is considered not only
   as an infallible cure, but which also serves as a charm against
   future attacks. This is nearly allied to a practice which was at
   one time very prevalent, and of which some traces may perhaps
   still exist, in what would be considered a more civilised part of
   the country, of wearing a small piece of the branch of the rowan
   tree, wrapped round with red thread, and sewn into some part of
   the garments, to guard against the effects of an "evil eye," or
   witchcraft:</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p>  "Rowan-tree and red thread</p>
      <p>Puts the witches to their speed."</p>

</div>

  <p> In the neighbourhood of Peterhead, there lived, a few years ago,
   a famous exorcist, whose ancestors had for several generations
   practised the same profession. He was greatly resorted to by
   parties in the Buchan district, for curing elfshot cattle, cows
   whose milk had been surreptitiously taken away, to recover stolen
   property and find out thieves, and put a stop to "cloddings."
   This latter description of <i>diablerie</i>, is just a repetition of
   the Cock Lane ghost's tricks, and occasionally yet occurs. On one
   occasion the exorcist was bearded in his own den: for about
   twenty-five years ago a terrible "clodding" took place at a
   farm-house in the parish of Longside, a mile or two from his own;
   it defied the united efforts of priest and layman to lay it, and
   the operator was called in, and while in the middle of one of his
   most powerful exorcisms, was struck on the side of his head with
   a piece of peat. The annoyance continued a few weeks, and then
   ceased altogether. In the parish of Banchory Ternan, about seven
   years ago, a "clodding" took place, which created considerable
   sensation in the district.</p>

<h4>
  <span> <i>Names of Places in Normandy and Orkney.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In reading Depping's
   <i>History of the Norman Maritime Expeditions</i>, my attention was
   directed to Appendix IX. vol. ii. p. 339., "Des Noms
   Topographiques de Normandie dont l'origine est étrangère." Many
   of the names given there resemble those in Orkney. I note a few
   of them.</p>

   <p>Depedal. Deepdale, a secluded valley near Kirkwall; <i>Dalv</i>,
   Icelandic, a valley.</p>

   <p>Auppegard, Eppegard in Normandy; Kongsgarth, Herdmansgarth in
   Orkney; Icelandic <i>Gardr</i>, a field, an enclosure.</p>

   <p>Cape La Hogue, derived by M. Depping from <i>hougr</i>, a promontory;
   Hoxay in Orkney, <i>hougs</i> and <i>ay</i>, an island. <i>Haugs-eid</i>,
   isthmus of the hillock, is another derivation.</p>

   <p>Cherbourg, Dep. p. 331.; Suhm, in a note appended, finds the root
   in his tongue, <i>skiair</i>, <i>skeer</i>; Icelandic <i>Sker</i>, a sea-rock,
   the Orkney <i>Skerry</i>, an islet covered at high water.</p>

  <p> Houlmes, near Rouen; the Orkney <i>Holm</i>, a small island generally
   uninhabited.</p>

   <p>Yvetot; Toft common in Orkney.</p>

  <p> Bye, a dwelling, is the Orkney Bu or Boo, a pure Icelandic word.</p>

<p>Other instances could be given; and there is nothing remarkable
   in this when it is considered that the invaders of Orkney and
   Normandy were the same people at the same period, and the better
   preservation of the Norse tongue in Orkney is readily to be
   accounted for. In Normandy the language of the invaders was lost
   in the French in a very short space of time, while the Norse
   continued the language of Orkney and Zetland during their
   subjection to the Norwegian earls for a period of 600 years; and
   only last year, 1850, it was that an old man in Unst in Zetland,
   who could speak Norse, died at the age of eighty-seven years; and
   except there be in Foula (Fougla, the fowls' island, called Thule
   in the Latin charters of its proprietors) a person living who can
   speak it, that old tongue is extinct in Britain.</p>

<h4>
<span>   <i>357. Meaning of Ploydes.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Perhaps the gentleman who has
   directed his attention to the folk lore of Lancashire (Vol. iii.,
   p. 55.) can tell the meaning of the word <i>ploydes</i> in the
   following rhythmical proverb. The three parishes of Prescot,
   Huyton, and Childwall adjoin each other, and lie to the east of
   Liverpool:&mdash;</p>

<h4>
<span>   <i>358. Green-eyed Monster.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Whence the origin of the "Green-eyed
   Monster"? The Italians considered a green iris beautiful, thus
   Dante makes Beatrice have "emerald eyes;" again, the Spaniards
   are loud in their praise. Whence, then, the epithet in its
   present sense?</p>

 <p class="right strong1"> ?</p>




<h4>
<span>   <i>359. Perpetual Lamp.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The ancient Romans are said to have
   preserved lights in their sepulchres many ages by the oiliness of
   gold, resolved by art into a liquid substance. And it is reported
   that, at the dissolution of monasteries, in the time of Henry
   VIII., there was a lamp found that had then burnt in a tomb from
   about 300 years after Christ, nearly 1200 years.</p>

<p>   Two of these subterranean lamps are to be seen in the Museum of
   Rarities at Leyden in Holland. One of these lamps, in the papacy
   of Paul III., was found in the tomb of Tullia, Cicero's daughter,
   which had been shut up 1550 years.</p>

   VIII.; and Robert Butts, Bishop of Norwich, and afterwards of

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers give me an

   are given, which profess to be taken from "a book of private
   devotions, printed for the use of the Unitas Fratrum, or
   Moravians." One of them is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "To you, ye wounds, we pay</p>
     <p> A thousand tears a-day,</p>
     <p> That you have us presented</p>

<p>The others look still more like burlesque. I cannot find them in

</h4>

<p>&mdash;When a man squanders his fortune, he is
   said in vulgar parlance to "make ducks and drakes of his money."
   Does this odd expression allude to the thoughtless school-boy
   practice of throwing stones as nearly as possible on a parallel
   with the surface of the water, whose elastic quality causes them
   frequently to rebound before they sink? In my younger days this
   amusement (so to speak) was called "ducks and drakes."</p>

<p>&mdash;I shall be much obliged by any

   in the Queen's County, Ireland, who held a commission as major in
   Cromwell's army. He married Ellen Loftus, the granddaughter of
   Sir Thos. Loftus of Killyan, one of the sons of Adam Loftus,
   Archbishop of Dublin; and, in 1670, had a grant of forfeited
   lands in the county of Kilkenny. I have reason to believe that he
   sprang from a family of that name in Sussex. His son, also named
   Vincent, was a lieutenant in Cottingham's regiment at the battle
   of the Boyne, Master of the Goldsmith's Company in Dublin in
   1696, and High Sheriff of Dublin in 1718. He married Elizabeth,
   the daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Proudfoot, and left issue. I shall be glad
   of any information as to the marriage of the last-named Vincent,
   and as to the family of Proudfoot.</p>

<p>&mdash;Every one who has travelled on the

   garden walls, and a <i>yew</i> hedge about thrice the height of the
   walls. It is said that one of our English poets once inhabited
   this house; but <i>who</i>? is a Query to which no one seems able to
   give an answer. Perhaps some of your numerous correspondents may
   have a Note on the subject, and would kindly furnish it. It is
   said by some to have been Young, the author of the <i>Night

   becoming of age in London) that St. Paul's was so." Now St.
   Paul's, as well as all other London clocks, keeps Greenwich time.
   Query, <i>Is</i> St. Paul's time legal time? Is it so because it is
   the cathedral clock of London, or because it is a commonly

<span><i>Inscription at Lyons.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;In Bishop Burnet's <i>Travels</i> (1685), he
mentions a monumental inscription which he saw at Lyons, of a certain
lady,<a id="Page_503"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[503]</span> "Quæ nimia pia"&mdash;"Facta est Impia," whom he conjectures,
and with some probability, to have been a Christian lady, declared
impious because she refused to confess the "Gods many and Lords many" of
the heathen. The conclusion of the epitaph is perplexing: it states that
her husband dedicated it to her and her son's memory&mdash;under "the
axe"&mdash;"Sub asciâ dedicavit." I have looked in vain for any explanation
of this expression, in any account within my reach of Roman funerals:
possibly some of your correspondents may help me to an explanation.
Burnet, while he is acute in noting the contradictory expression above,
wholly overlooks this. It may mean that her husband performed this act
of piety in the face of danger and persecution,&mdash;as we should say, "with
the axe hanging over his head;" but then the epitaph commences with the
letters D. M., signifying "Diis Manibus," leading to the conclusion that
the husband was not himself a Christian, though respecting Christianity
in the person of his wife. I had not originally intended to copy the
epitaph; but as it is not long, and may help the speculations of your
readers who have not access to Burnet's <i>Travels</i>, p. 5., now a rare

<h3>
<span>GENERAL JAMES WOLFE.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 438.)</span>
</h3>

<p>In answer to the Queries put to me by &#540;. I have to state&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That I am totally unable to give any information relative to the
family of Mrs. Wolfe.</p>

<p>2d. Edward Wolfe was not, I believe, a native of Westerham, and only
resided there when not on active duty. His wife lived there some years,
but could only have been staying temporarily in the house where her son
was born, as it always was the residence of the vicar; the room, named
after him, is still pointed out where James Wolfe drew his first breath.
Quebec House was only rented by Edward Wolfe: to this house James was
very early removed, and, as I have always been informed, always resided
in it till he entered on his military studies; if so, he must have been
educated in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>3rd. Sir Jeffrey Amherst is the same person as &#540;. alludes to; I was
wrong, perhaps, in using the term "patronise." Wolfe and he were,
however, staunch friends through life; Amherst ever encouraged Wolfe,
who was liable to fits of despondency, and always represented him at
head quarters as one worthy of a high command in those trying times.
Amherst was afterwards executor to Mrs. Wolfe's will.</p>

<p>I feel gratified that the letters mentioned corroborate my assertion as
to his birth; not only is the date I gave on the tablet in Westerham
church, but was informed of the various accounts by a former curate of
Westerham, who assured me the date on the tablet was the correct one.</p>

<p>The circumstance of Barré's friendship with Wolfe is interesting, and I
am now enabled to mention another friend, on whom Wolfe equally relied,
viz. General Hugh Debbieg, who fought with him at Louisbourgh, and
afterwards followed him to Quebec, where he directed part of the
engineering operations.</p>

<p>The soldier who supported Wolfe after he received his death-wound, was
named James; he was in the artillery; he likewise served at Louisbourgh
and Quebec, and survived till 1812, when he died at Carlisle Castle,
where he had been stationed for many years as a bombardier, aged
ninety-two.</p>

<p>In no notice of him I have read, is he mentioned as having been at
Carthagena. The <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> mentions the chief engagements he was
in, but makes no allusion to Carthagena whatever.</p>

<p>Southey and Gleig contemplated writing the life of Wolfe; but some
unknown circumstance prevented the completion of so laudable a
design.<a id="Page_504"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[504]</span></p>

<p>In George's <i>Westerham Journal</i> is a curious account of Mrs. Wolfe
adopting a young man named Jacob Wolfe, and of Lord Amherst obtaining,
by her representations, a place of 700<i>l.</i> a-year for him. It is
extracted from Trusler's <i>Memoirs</i>; but being too lengthy for insertion
in "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," I will copy it out, if &#540;. wishes to have it.</p>

<p>In Thackery's <i>Life of the Earl of Chatham</i> is mentioned the following
anecdote, which I have often seen otherwise applied: George II. was once
expressing his admiration of Wolfe, when some one observed that the
General was mad. "Oh! mad is he?" said the King; "then I wish he would
bite some of my other generals." Other information occurs in the same
work.</p>

<p>I have learnt that a family named Wolfe was settled at Saffron Walden,
Essex, in the last century, and the obituary of <i>Sylvanus Urban for
1794</i>, p. 770., records the death of the lady of Thomas Wolfe, Esq., of
that place. Does this give a clue as to the county in which George Wolfe
settled?</p>

<p>I had intended to have applied myself to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" relative to
our hero; and though I have been anticipated, I will still endeavour to
follow up my enquiries, and all I can obtain shall be at the service of
&#540;., in the hope that something substantial may be done to rescue from
the comparative oblivion the life of one of England's greatest sons.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "When these levies, made up of 400 foot soldiers and 1200
   horsemen, whose leader was La Jaille, one of the principal
   nobility of Anjou, had made a foray on the enemy's border, and
   driven off an immense booty; upon their retreat, which, being men
   for the most part utterly ignorant of military service, they
   conducted with great disorder, between Arras and Bapaume, they
   were entrapped by Osmand, who commanded in those parts, into an
   ambuscade set for them close to their line of march, with a wood
   in their front and a river below them. A few of them were slain,
   but the greater part, inasmuch as there was no way of escape,
   were taken<a id="Page_505"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[505]</span> prisoners: which gave occasion to the following
   satirical play upon words: '<i>That Flemings had taken French

   name of 'the noble.'"</p>

<p>The last instance shows the common opinion entertained of the Flemings,
as being traders far too keen to take any coin except it were of full
tale and weight. And although the expression "Flemish account" may have
originated from their practice as merchants, yet, from the second
instance quoted from Ford and Decker, it may not unreasonably be
inferred that it received greater currency from their method of paying
the soldiers who also served as mercenaries in the wars of the Low
Countries.</p>

<h3>
<span>POPE AND FLATMAN.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 132.)</span>
</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">ARTON</span>, in his "Note" on Pope and Flatman, inquires whether the
coincidence mentioned by him has been noticed before. I believe it has,
by more than one commentator, and among others by Croly in his edition
of Pope, London, E. J. Valpy, 1835. Dr. Croly introduces the ode of "The
Dying Christian to his Soul," with these remarks, from which it will be
seen that Flatman was not the only source of Pope's inspiration:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Pope, in a letter to Steele, at whose suggestion he had adopted
   the subject, gives this brief history of his composition:&mdash;'You
   have it,' he says, 'as Cowley calls it, warm from the brain; it
   came to me the first moment I waked this morning; yet you'll see
   it was not so absolutely inspiration but that I had in my head
   not only the verses of Hadrian, but the fine fragment of Sappho.'
   Pope omitted to observe the close similarity of his lines to
   those of Flatman, an obscure writer of the century before.
   Between his rough versification and the polished elegance of Pope
   there can be no comparison; but the thoughts are the same. Prior
   translated Hadrian's ode with more fidelity, but less good
   fortune."</p>

<h3>
<span>DERIVATION OF "LONDON."<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 437.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I beg to suggest that the word <i>London</i> is derived from the Celtic
<i>Luan</i>, "the moon," and <i>dun</i>, "a city on a hill;" thus <i>Luandun</i> would
mean "the city of the moon," <i>i.e.</i> of "the temple of the moon." I have
seen it stated somewhere, that the site of St. Paul's was formerly that
of a temple of Diana: if this be true, it gives weight to my definition
of the word. I would also suggest that the name of <i>Greenwich</i> is
indicative of the religious worship of the ancient people of Britain; as
<i>Grian</i> is "the sun" in Celtic, and no doubt Greenwich could boast of
its "Grynean grove."</p>

<p> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RANCIS</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span>.</p>


<p>M. C. E. is referred to the two following passages from Fuller, if he
has not already met with them:&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "That it was so termed from <i>Lan Dian</i>, a temple of Diana
   (standing where now St. Paul's doth) is most likely, in my
   opinion."&mdash;<i>Worthies</i>, art. "London."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"This renders their conceit not unlikely who will have London so
   called from <i>Llan Dian</i>, which signifieth in British, 'the temple
   of Diana.'"&mdash;<i>Church History</i>, i. § 2.</p>

    <p class="right">J. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTWOOD</span>.</p>

<p>The name of <i>London</i> is certainly older than the Romans, and is
probably, therefore, as your correspondent says, British. Its
significance, if any, therefore, is to be sought in Welsh. Now, your
correspondent is certainly quite wrong as to the meaning of <i>Llan</i> in
Welsh. It always means, here at any rate, <i>church</i>, not <i>plain</i>.
Possibly your correspondent was thinking of <i>Llano</i>. The word is written
in Welsh <i>Llyndon</i>, or <i>Llyndain</i>, which also speaks against its being
compounded with <i>Llan</i>. The word certainly <i>might</i> mean anything: but I
know of no satisfactory explanation having been given for it as yet. The
only words for <i>town</i> in Welsh are, I believe, <i>tre</i> "city," or <i>caer</i>
"castle,"&mdash;as parts of compound words, I mean.</p>

  <p class="right"> S<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span></p>

  <p class="left">Carmarthen.</p>

<p>I cannot think that M. C. E.'s etymology of <i>London</i> is a correct one;
nor did I know that the British <i>Llan</i> means a "level place generally."
I take it that originally <i>Llan</i> meant no more than "an inclosure," as
we see in <i>winllan</i>, "a vineyard," "an inclosure for vines;" <i>perllan</i>,
"an orchard" (literally a pear-yard). As churchyards were probably for
some time almost the only inclosures in their districts, this will
explain why the names of churches in Wales so commonly begin with
<i>Llan</i>. Llanvair, Llanilltid, Llandilo, &amp;c. were the <i>inclosures</i>, or
yards, in which churches dedicated to St. Mary, St. Iltyd, St. Teilo,
&amp;c. were built, though in the course of time these names became applied
to the churches themselves. The word <i>don</i> is nothing more than <i>din</i>,
or <i>dinas</i>, "a fortress," as we see in Lugdunum, Virodunum, Londinium,
Dumbarton, Dunmore, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Old chroniclers say that the city of London was nearly, if not entirely,
surrounded by water, which on the north, north-east, and south sides
spread out into considerable lakes. Present names of localities in and
about the City show traces of this. Finsbury and Moorfields take their

<p>Bearing in mind that British names were generally descriptive of the

<p>&mdash;The following
beautiful legend of the Robin Redbreast, which I have just met with, was
quite new to me. If you think it likely to be so to T. Y. or any other
of your readers, you will perhaps find a place for it.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>Eusebia.</i>&mdash;Like that sweet superstition current in Brittany,
   which would explain the cause why the robin redbreast has always
   been a favourite and <i>protégé</i> of man. While our Saviour was
   bearing <span class="smcap lowercase">HIS</span> cross, one of these birds, they say, took one thorn
   from <span class="smcap lowercase">HIS</span> crown, which dyed its breast; and ever since that time

verse. In the evening, grown persons go round singing and collecting
contributions from house to house. It is universally believed in this

applied to the purpose of procuring masses for the souls of the dead.</p>

<span><i>Clekit House</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 473.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;With reference to this Query, I beg
to suggest the following explanation. In Scotland, a <i>cleek</i> signifies a
hook; and to <i>cleek</i>, is to hook or join together: thus, a lady and
gentleman walking arm-in-arm are said to be <i>cleekit</i> together. The word
is in full use at present, and has been so for centuries; and I think it
not improbable that at the time the will referred to was written, the
word might be common to both countries. On this supposition the meaning
would be, that the "two tenements" communicated with each other in some
way&mdash;probably by a bridge thrown across&mdash;so as to form <i>one</i> house,
which obtained its name from their being thus joined or <i>cleekit</i>
together.</p>

the old church of St. James, Clerkenwell, which was formerly part of the
Priory called <i>Ecclesia Beatæ Mariæ de Fonte Clericorum</i>, for nuns of
the order of St. Benedict. The inscription, on a plate shaped to a
pillar near the chancel, has been preserved by Stow, in his <i>Survey of
London</i>, p. 900., 1633; and by Strype, in his edition of the <i>Survey of
London</i>, book iv. p. 65. Fuller, in his <i>Church History</i>, vol. ii p.
208., edit. 1840, informs us that&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Weever died in London in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and
   was buried in St. James, Clerkenwell, where he appointed this
   epitaph for himself:</p>

<p>The date supplied by Storer, in his <i>History of Clerkenwell</i>, p. 186.,
is "Anno Domini 1632." The epitaph given by Fuller, Strype has appended
to the original inscription. Mr. Storer adds:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "When the church was taken down, the Society of Antiquaries gave
   orders for a diligent search to be made after this tablet, but
   without success; which is accounted for by a correspondent in the

<p>&mdash;The word "cabal" occurs in two different

1779, and so cannot tell whether Butler used it at a date previous to
that assigned to its coinage by Burnet. <i>Hudibras</i> was written before
the Restoration, at all events; but I have no opportunity of consulting
the first edition, which was well known for ten years before the <i>Cabal</i>
of 1672.</p>

   <i>British Librarian</i>, No. 6. for June, 1737, p. 340."</p>

<p>The other instance I am adducing gives us "cabal" in its common
acceptation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Set up committees of <i>cabals</i></p>

<p>Your correspondent E. H. D. D. may be glad of these two quotations, and
I quite agree with him in ascribing an earlier date than that mentioned
by Burnet to the word "cabal" in the sense of "a secret council." The
transition from its original sense was easy and natural, and the
application to King Charles's confidential advisers ingenious.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Rectitudines Singularum Personarum</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 442.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In reply to
the inquiries of H. C. C., let me refer him to pp. xi. and xxv. of the
preface and list of MSS. in vol. i. of the <i>Ancient Laws, &amp;c. of
England</i>, edited by Mr. Thorpe, under the direction of the late Record
Commission. He will there find that the real MS. site of that document
is stated to be in the library of Corpus Christi, Cambridge, and to be
of the date of the tenth century. It is not stated upon what ground so
early a date is assigned to it; but as so competent a judge as the
editor seems to give that date without any expression of doubt, we may
presume that there is satisfactory proof of the fact. I do not observe
the document mentioned in Wanley's catalogue, and Nasmith's more recent
one is not at hand to refer to. The matter contained in it does not (at
least in my judgment) <i>necessarily</i> indicate so early a date, inasmuch
as parallel, and even identical, rights and customs, connected with the
<i>status</i> of persons and tenure of land, were in active existence at a
much later period of our history. It would certainly be more
satisfactory to know the precise grounds, whether extrinsic or
intrinsic, on which the date has been fixed.</p>

<p>With regard to the old Latin version, I will not undertake to vindicate
it except against <i>one</i> of the criticisms of H. C. C. He objects that
<i>læden</i> is translated <i>minare</i>. The word "minare" is used in the
translation twice, once for <i>driving</i>, and once for <i>leading</i>; and I
question whether the translator could have found a more appropriate word
to serve this double purpose than the authentic verb <i>menare</i> or
<i>minare</i>, from which the French <i>mener</i> has been derived.</p>

<p>I cannot so easily justify him for translating "bôc-riht" by "rectitudo
testamenti;" yet as the power of testamentary disposition was one of the
most signal attributes of bôc-riht, I cannot say that he has much
misrepresented the import of the original word.</p>

<p>The document, which is evidently a private compilation, seems to be a
custumal, or coustumier, of a district, or some considerable portion of
the country. The German lawyers would call the collection a landrecht in
one sense of that term, or, as the translator has called it, a
"landirectum." The heading is by no means an appropriate one. Whether
the writer intended to compile a code of the customs and obligations of
land tenure, free and unfree, coextensive with the Saxon name, or merely
to represent those of a certain district with which he happened to be
acquainted, is a matter open to question.</p>

<p>H. C. C. is perhaps not aware that the document has been examined,
corrected, translated into German, and made the subject of a very
masterly dissertation, by Dr. Heinrich Leo, of Halle. It is frequently
referred to by Lappenberg in his <i>Anglo-Saxon History</i>, and became known
(at least in the translation) to Sir H. Ellis in time to make copious
extracts from it in the second volume of his <i>Introduction to Domesday</i>.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Island and Temple of Ægina</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 255. 412.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Having
been, some time since, greatly pleased by a fine engraving of the ruined
Temple of Jupiter Panhellenius in Ægina (but unaccompanied by any
description), and having had a well executed water-colour drawing made
therefrom, my interest was aroused on the subject, and I searched among
books within reach for particulars on the subject of what there seems
every reason to regard as the oldest temple in Greece, with the single
exception of that of Corinth. After a patient search I found Fosbroke's
<i>Foreign Topography</i> (4to. edition, 1828, pp. 3, 4, 5.) to contain the
best account of those interesting<a id="Page_509"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[509]</span> ruins. The work is not a scarce
one in good libraries: I shall therefore be concise in the extracts from
it. The article entitled "Ægina (Greece)" states that the remains of the
Temple of Jupiter Panhellenius (which are engraved in the <i>Ionian
Antiquities</i>) prove it to have been of the Doric order; that it had six
columns in front, but only twelve on the side, in opposition to the
usual custom among Greek architects of adding one column more than
double the number of those in front. The architecture is said closely to
approach that of the hexastyle hypæthral Temple of Pæstum. Williams, in
his <i>Travels</i>, expresses the opinion that this Temple of Jupiter is
older than that of Theseus or the Parthenon. In Dodwell's <i>Greece</i>, too,
there is an ample description of it. He represents it to have been part
of the ruins of an ancient city, perhaps of Oië. Twenty-five columns
were left entire in his day; together with the greater part of the
epistylion, or architrave. The cornice, however, with the metopæ and
triglyphs, have all fallen. The view of this gloriously positioned
temple must have been magnificent from the sea; while the details of the
building must have been equally delighting to the near spectator. The
temple was built of soft porous stone, coated with a thin stucco, which
must have given it a marble appearance. The epistylia were painted, and
the cornice elegantly ornamented in a similar manner. The pavement was
also covered with a thick stucco, painted vermilion. Chandler (<i>Greece</i>,
12-15.) describes traces of the peribolus of this temple; and Clarke
styles it at once the most ancient and remarkable in Greece. I may add
that the Æginetans were celebrated for their works in bronze, for fine
medals (the art of coining money indeed being first introduced by the
inhabitants of this island), for their terra cotta vases, &amp;c. Fosbroke's
excellent <i>Cyclopædia of Antiquities</i> may be with advantage consulted in
respect to the Eginetic school of art.</p>

published by Stevenson of Edinburgh, 1842, I find it stated that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Mr. Walter Macfarlan of Macfarlan (<i>Scoticè</i>, of that Ilk) was
   an eminent antiquary, who devoted his attentions strictly to the
   historical monuments of his own country, especially the
   ecclesiastic remains. He caused to be made, at his own expense,
   by his clerk, one Tait, copies of most of the chartularies
   accessible in his time. These are distinguished for their
   fidelity and neatness. Mr. Macfarlan died 5th June, 1767, and his
   MSS. were purchased by the Faculty of Advocates."</p>

<p>Of these valuable and highly important chartularies there has been
printed, 1. Aberdeen; 2. Arbroath; 3. Balmerino; 4. Dryburgh; 5.
Dunfermline; 6. Kelso; 7. Lindores; 8. Melros; 9. Moray; 10. St.
Andrews; and 11. Scone.</p>

<p>According to Douglas, in his <i>Baronage of Scotland</i>, folio, 1798&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Mr. Macfarlane was a man of parts, learning, and knowledge, a
   most ingenious antiquary, and by far the best genealogist of his
   time. He was possessed of the most valuable collection of
   materials for a work of this kind of any man in the kingdom,
   which he collected with great judgment, and at a considerable
   expense, and to which we always had, and still have, free access.
   This sufficiently appears by the many quotations from
   Macfarlane's collections, both in the Peerage and Baronage of
   Scotland. In short, he was a man of great benevolence, an
   agreeable companion, and a sincere friend.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "He married Lady Elizabeth Erskine, daughter of Alexander, sixth
   earl of Kelly, and died without issue in June, 1767."</p>

<p>In the year 1846 there was engraved at the expense of W. B. C. C.
Turnbull, Esq., advocate, a fine portrait of Macfarlane, from the
original painting in the Library of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries.
Of this plate it is believed that only a few "proofs upon India paper"
were thrown off for presents.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>When Heminge and Condell put forth the first folio of Shakspeare in
1623, as if with a fine prescience of<a id="Page_510"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[510]</span> the immortal fame which was
destined to await the writings of their "so worthy Friend and Fellow,"
they addressed the volume to all, "from the most able to him that can
but read." And it is obvious from the moderate price at which it has
been issued, that the proprietor of the handsome one-volume edition
which has just appeared under the title of <i>The Lansdowne Shakspeare</i>
looks for purchasers within the same wide range. The book is indeed well
calculated to win favour from all classes. The text, which is based on
that of Collier, compared with that of the first folio and the editions
of Steevens, Malone, Knight, &amp;c., is clearly and distinctly printed; the
names of the characters being given, not only at full length, and in the
middle of the page, but also in red ink. The stage directions are
distinguished in the like manner. It has, moreover, the Dedicatory
Address and Commendatory Verses from the original edition; and, what
certainly deserves especial mention, an admirable facsimile by Robinson
of the portrait by Droeshout, which, on the authority of Ben Jonson's
well-known declaration, that it was a work&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p> "Wherein the Graver had a strife</p>
      <p>With Nature, to out doo the life:</p>
      <p>O could he but have drawne his wit</p>
     <p> <i>As well in brasse as he hath hit</i></p>
      <p><i>His face</i>; the Print would then surpasse</p>
      <p>All that was ever writ in brasse"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>is by many regarded as the most authentic portrait of the great poet.
Altogether, therefore, <i>The Lansdowne Shakspeare</i> is a beautiful book,
and well deserves to be both the library and travelling companion of
every lover of poetry&mdash;of every student of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>Our correspondent, Dr. Henry, has published a miscellaneous volume under
the title of <i>Unripe Windfalls</i>, which consists of some amusing <i>vers de
société</i>&mdash;a Letter addressed to ourselves, containing some very
trenchant criticism on the obscurities of Lord Byron; and, lastly, some
specimens of Dr. Henry's <i>Virgilian Commentaries</i>, some few of which
have appeared in our columns. This fact, coupled with the letter
addressed to ourselves, must preclude us from speaking of the volume in
those terms of commendation which we should otherwise have felt it right
to employ.</p>

<p><i>Outlines of Comparative Physiology touching the Structure and
Development of the Races of Animals Living and Extinct</i>, by L. Agassiz
and A. A. Gould, <i>edited from the Revised Edition and greatly enlarged</i>
by T. Wright, M.D., is the new issue of Bohn's <i>Scientific Library</i>. The
present volume forms the first part of the <i>Principles of Zoology</i>,
which was designed by Professor Agassiz, in conjunction with Mr. Gould,
as a text book for the use of the higher schools and colleges, for
which, as the editor remarks, it is well adapted from its simplicity of
style, clearness of arrangement, and its important and comprehensive
range of subjects. In the present edition the woodcut illustrations have
been increased from 170 to 390, thereby adding greatly to the value of a
work which is well calculated to furnish the general reader with
trustworthy information upon the matter to which it relates.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;<i>The Literary and Scientific Register and Almanac for
1852</i>, edited by J. W. G. Gutch, puts forth this&mdash;its eleventh
appearance&mdash;with increased claims to public favour in the shape of many
important additions and improvements, in the great mass of condensed
information which it contains. <i>The Orations of M. T. Cicero literally
translated by</i> C. D. Yonge, B.A. <i>Vol. I. containing the Orations for
Quintius, Sextus Roscius, Quintus Roscius, against Quintius Cæcilius and
against Verres</i>, is the new volume of Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>. The
fifth volume of <i>Neander's General History of the Christian Religion and
Church</i> (of the value of which we have already spoken) forms the new
issue of the same enterprising publisher's <i>Standard Library</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">THE LANSDOWNE SHAKESPEARE. This beautiful One-volume Edition of the
Englishman's household book, perfectly unique in the annals of printing,
and dedicated, by express permission, to the Most Noble the Marquis of
Lansdowne, is now ready.</p>

<p>It has been produced, regardless of cost, in order that it may take a
permanent position as a gentleman's hand-book abroad and a drawing-room
bijou at home. Its characteristics will be found in uniting with its
portability a clearness and facility in reading hitherto unattained in
any edition, the text being from the latest and best Authorities; and,
for the first time in any edition of Shakespeare, the names of the
characters are placed in the centre of the page, unabridged, on the plan
adopted in the plays of Molière, Racine, Corneille, Goethe, and
Schiller; and which arrangement has been still further greatly improved
by printing them, and also the whole of the Stage Directions, in red
ink, the text being in black; thus rendering the pages of Shakespeare as
pleasant and easy to read as a Novel by Scott, and for facility of
reference unequalled.</p>

<p>To Printers this volume will appear extraordinary for its cheapness and
the great care required in its production, nearly 1,200 pages, of a
minute character, being printed in different coloured inks.</p>

<p>A magnificent Portrait has been engraved for this Edition, by H.
ROBINSON, in Line, after Droeshout's Engraving to the first folio, and
of which a few impressions have been taken on large paper separately.
These may be had Proofs, 5<i>s.</i>; Prints, 3<i>s.</i> each.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
